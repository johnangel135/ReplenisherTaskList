### This is the main way to configure the application (other than annotations).
### This file is in Yaml format but you can also configure spring boot using the traditional
### Java properties file format.

spring.jmx:
   enabled: false

spring.datasource:
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/walmart
    username: root
    password: admin
server:
  port: 8090

#todo: make sure to always enable security in production
security:
  basic:
    enabled: false

#management endpoints on a separate port
management:
  port: 8091
  security:
    enabled: false # management port is internal only. no need to secure it.
